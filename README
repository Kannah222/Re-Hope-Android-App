The Re:Hope Android App!
http://rehope.co.uk

With a few tweaks this application can be used for your own church. Here's what you'll need to set up the app:

1. A WordPress blog with the 'rehope' plugin installed and correctly configured. You can find the plugin in the home folder of the repo.

2. Posts created on the blog that are in one of 3 categories:
	- 'Featured' posts are used for the swipe header on the home tab.  Set up three of these with an image in the post content at 444x158 resolution.  You can optionally set a custom field in the post named 'link' to send the user to a URL or tab when the image is tapped.  Setting the 'link' value to 'events' or 'messages' will load the named tab instead of a URL. 
	- 'Events' posts are used for the events tab and the two latest events are displayed in the home tab.  Give them an image with a 140x140 resolution, and add a date custom field in this format: '2011-05-15'. Place the content of the event in the 'excerpt' field in WordPress.  You can also provide a city_link custom field to load the event on your Church's city site.  (if you don't use the city, just remove the city tab from the app).
	- 'Messages' are similar to events, but you can also add an 'mp3_url' custom field so that the app will stream an MP3 when the 'listen now' button is tapped.
	
3. On the Android side, change the package name to something else. Then customize your blog's url and GPS coordinates in Home.java.

4. Replace the Re:Hope specific branding with your church's!  (The black, red and blue theme is part of our branding so we'd appreciate it if you used different graphic resources for your app)

5. That's it!
